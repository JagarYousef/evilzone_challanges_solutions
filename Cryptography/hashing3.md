1. For this challenge we need some bruteforce, download [Kraken](https://kraken.nswardh.com/readme)
2. Install Kraken and go to its installation folder (mostly on desktop)
3. Save the hash to a file inside `Recovery` folder, e.g. `hash.txt`
3. Here you have 2 options; the easiest one to download a dictionary, the another one is to do bruteforce that will take
   a long time; very long.
4. Get a dictionay and save it to `dictionay.txt` inside `Dictiona` folder
   e.g:

```text
root
password123
password
newPass
Pass
admin
login
```

5. Start Kraken, Start New > Hashed passwords > Dictionary > Normal
